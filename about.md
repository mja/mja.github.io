I study the evolution of individual differences and the genetic and environmental architecture of complex mental health traits.

I am a statistical geneticist in the [Mental Health Data Science Scotland](https://mhdss.ac.uk) group at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-mark-james-adams).
