## Mark James Adams

I study the evolution of individual differences and the genetic and environmental architecture of complex mental health traits.

I am a statistical geneticist in the [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences](https://clinical-brain-sciences.ed.ac.uk), Senior Bioinformatician for [Generation Scotland](http://generationscotland.org), and a lead analyst for the [Major Depressive Disorder Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium](https://pgc.unc.edu).
